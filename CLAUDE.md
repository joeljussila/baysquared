# CLAUDE.md — delta and bay (deltaandbay)

Read `docs/CHAT_HANDOFF.md` first for current shared context, production decisions and pending requests. Inspect Git status and uncommitted changes before editing; multiple chats may be working simultaneously.

This folder is the home for all work on the delta and bay project (Shenzhen robotics trip landing page). Make every change here.

- Brand: **Delta & Bay**, capitalised, with an ampersand (Shawn, 16 Oct 2026; replaces the earlier lowercase request). Use `deltaandbay` for folders, repos, file names and URLs. Formerly delta and bay, bay^2 (baysquared), before that SOMMER.
- Hero title: **Bridging Frontiers**, with "Shenzhen · San Francisco", the dates, **Apply for a place** and "Applications reviewed on a rolling basis · ~20 places" under it. The name sits under the monogram top-left as the brand-kit lockup (`images/deltaandbay_lockup_ivory.svg`, outlines from Shawn's LinkedIn logo; never retype it). Navigation, section headings and buttons use sentence case.
- Plain static HTML, no framework, no build. Keep it that way unless asked.
- Original style directions: `1a` Space, `2f` Sepia, `2h` Threshold, `3d` Glass hand, plus `3d-ochre`, `3d-clay`, `3d-night`. See README.md.
- Live direction is `3d-night`: Shawn's brand colours (Prussian blue `#050A30`, ivory `#ECE8E0`), the monogram-and-name lockup top-left (`images/deltaandbay_lockup_ivory.svg`). Display type is **Michroma** (hero title, tagline in spaced capitals, headings, FAQ questions, prices; chosen by Shawn 16 Oct 2026); body text stays IBM Plex Mono. A fixed edge glow (brand-kit blues) fades in below the hero and drifts with scroll. `apply/` matches it.
- `apply/` saves to Supabase project `deltaandbay` (ref `kmbhcqnkbiddppzbubxp`, us-west-1), table `public.applications`, via the REST API with the publishable key. RLS: public can insert only (no read/update/delete); read applications in the Supabase dashboard. Schema in `supabase/migrations/`. If you add or rename a form field, update the table, the column grant and the `FIELDS` list in the page script together. Fields follow the applicant questions in the planning doc; the rest of those questions are asked on the interview call.
- Images are shared in `images/` as `deltaandbay_pic*.jpg`; pages reference them as `../images/<file>`. More source photos are in the user's Downloads folder, still named `sommer_pic1..23.jpg`.
- `3d-night` is a scrolling page: full-screen hero, then sections (trip, itinerary, FAQ, price, apply). Keep it to key facts only. No countdown. The itinerary names kinds of hosts, never company names or logos (the full itinerary goes to accepted participants). Price shows named tiers (Founding, Early bird, Regular, Final call) and never seat counts. The Apply section holds the three steps: apply, 15-minute call, decision within 2 days. Nav links jump to `#trip`, `#faq`; `Apply` goes to `../apply/`.
- Trip: 11–17 January 2027. Content source is the Google Doc "Make it out of the hood".
- Deploy target: Vercel project `deltaandbay` (domain deltaandbay.com), auto-deployed from GitHub `joeljussila/deltaandbay` main. `/` is rewritten to the live direction in `vercel.json` (currently `3d-night`); the picker is at `/styles/`.



- Live pages use Prussian blue (#050A30) with no video blend overlays. The one gradient is the brand edge glow below the hero, which Shawn asked for on 16 Oct 2026; don't add others. The video and its poster are color-graded blue directly in their files.

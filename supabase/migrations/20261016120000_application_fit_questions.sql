-- Tap-to-choose questions added to /apply on 16 Oct 2026, so the 15-minute call can be prepared in advance.
-- NOT YET APPLIED. Apply in the Supabase SQL editor BEFORE deploying the new apply/index.html:
-- the new form sends these columns, and inserts fail until they exist.
-- All columns are nullable so earlier applications stay valid. The personal website field left the form;
-- its column stays for existing rows.
begin;
-- "Can you join for the full trip?" gains a "Not sure yet" answer.
